# Health Analysis Projects
In this repository are projects related to healthcare data analysis using SQL and SAS.
Raw data are sourced from the Framingham Heart Study and Medicare Claims synthetic data from CMS.   

# OMOP_Cohorts
For this project I utilized SQL to create a cohort of patients who have cancer and their vital status, using synthetic Medicare Claims files in the OMOP Common Data Model.   

# FraminghamStudy_Analysis
For this project I utilized SAS to analyze the odds ratio between cholesterol levels and diabetes incidence following a retrospective cohort study design, using data from the Framingham Heart Study.

# MedicareClaims_SuperUtilizers
For this project I utilized SAS to identify top 5% super-utilizers from synthetic Medicare Claims data and created a logistic predictive model for risk of readmission within 30 days.
